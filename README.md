# radio-snippets

This repository gathers some snippets dedicated to radio streaming softwares and radio management. Source codes are provided as-is. You can do what you want with them. I may update the snippets in the future but I won't assume the maintenance to fix bugs or if you request some help. Just consider this repository as a knowledge archive of snippets. Thanks :)

## Projects

All snippets are developed with Javascript (VueJS) and the Web Audio API when needed. Feel free to translate in any programming language you want with any framework you want :)

### Cue points

# radio-snippets
This repository gathers some snippets dedicated to radio streaming softwares and radio management. Source codes are provided as-is. You can do what you want with them. I may update the snippets in the future but I won't assume the maintenance to fix bugs or if you request some help. Just consider this repository as a knowledge archive of snippets. Thanks :)
